Likely Ideas:
-Temple Run style (endless runner), 
-Flappy Bird (endless game),
-bomberman (local play),
-Tekken/Fighting game (local play, really like this idea),
-tank trouble (would be very simple),
-general stealth game (if discovered instant fail/death, get from point to point),

Less Likely Ideas:
-metal gear solid (just really like the game and its mechanics),
-polybridge (get cars across a player built bridge but a lot of physics needed),
-Mario Party (local play, no networking)
-Crash Team Racing/Mario Kart Style racer (player vs AI)
-Crash Bandicoot (adventure style game, point to point adventure with enemies/obstacles)
