EmberCore the game.
EmberCore is a player vs player fighting game inspired by Mortal Kombat.
Please read the Reflections.txt file, it details my opinions and thought about the project and how i achieved/failed my expectations of the project at the start of the year
Player 1 controls: 1=punch, 2=kick, 3=fireball, SPACEBAR=jump
Player 2 controls: numpad1=punch, numpad2=kick, numpad3=fireball, numpad0=jump
3D animation was incorporated by bringing in the 2 background characters with their animations (guy on fire near plane and guy in background cheering on the building)
